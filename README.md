## Creating a new Creation
1. To create a new creation, press the "New Creation" button on the bottom right hand corner
	
2. Enter the name of your new creation in the text box. Names must contain at least one character that isn't a space, and all characters must be either letters, numbers, spaces, underscores or hyphens.
		
	i) If you see a "Creation already exists" error. This means that a creation with that name
		   already exists and you have the option to "Override" it.
		   Remember that "Creation" and "creation" and "creation  " are the same.
		
	ii) If you see a "Please type a valid name" error, you may have likely entered an invalid name
		   which is unaccepted as a creation name. 

3. Click the "Next" or "Override" button to go on to the next stage, or click anywhere outside the dialog box to get back to the main menu

4. In the Recording page, you will be prompted to record yourself saying the name of the creation. Click the "Record" button to start recording for 5 seconds.

5. After recording, you can listen to what you have just recorded, redo the recording, or keep the audio as is and save the creation.

6. The new creation is displayed in the list on the main menu.
